Welcome to the AtliQ Hardware Sales Insights project! This project is a culmination of my SQL learning journey, completed under the guidance of mentors Dhaval Patel and Hemanand at codebasics.io

## Overview

AtliQ Hardware is an imaginary company, and this project aims to provide valuable insights into its sales data. The project includes a series of SQL queries, stored procedures, and data analysis to answer various business questions and improve decision-making.
